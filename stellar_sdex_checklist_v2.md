# Hummingbot Stellar SDEX Connector: Corrected Implementation Checklist v2.0

## Overview & Strategic Alignment

**CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE CORRECTION**: Direct Hummingbot Client Connector (Python-based)

**Timeline**: 10-12 weeks total development time (revised upward)
**Risk Level**: LOW-MEDIUM (corrected architecture eliminates major risks)

### Critical Dependencies Verified:
- ✅ **Stellar Python SDK Protocol 23 compatible** 
- ✅ **Hummingbot connector patterns documented**
- ⚠️ **Python/Stellar expertise required** (not TypeScript)
- ⚠️ **10-12 week dedicated development time**
