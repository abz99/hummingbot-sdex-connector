# ADR-003: Enterprise Security Framework

## Status
**Accepted** - 2025-09-06

## Context
Trading connectors handle sensitive financial operations requiring enterprise-grade security. The project must protect:
- Private keys for Stellar account operations
- Trading credentials and API keys  
- User transaction data and PII
- High-value trading operations

**Security Requirements:**
- Hardware Security Module (HSM) support for key operations
- Multi-Party Computation (MPC) for distributed signing
- Hardware wallet integration for offline key storage
- Comprehensive audit logging for compliance
- Zero-trust architecture with least privilege access

**Compliance Considerations:**
- Financial services regulations (PCI DSS, SOX)
- Cryptocurrency AML/KYC requirements
- Data protection (GDPR, CCPA)
- Enterprise audit trail requirements

## Decision
**Implement comprehensive enterprise security framework** with layered defense:

1. **Multi-tier Key Management**
   - HSM integration for production keys
   - Hardware wallet support for user keys
   - MPC protocols for distributed operations
   - Secure key derivation (BIP-44/SLIP-0010)

2. **Zero-Trust Architecture** 
   - All operations authenticated and authorized
   - Minimal privilege access control
   - Comprehensive audit logging
   - Encrypted communication channels

3. **Security Infrastructure**
   ```python
   class StellarSecurityManager:
       def __init__(self):
           self.hsm_provider = HSMProvider()
           self.mpc_coordinator = MPCCoordinator()
           self.hardware_wallets = HardwareWalletManager()
           self.audit_logger = SecurityAuditLogger()
   ```

## Consequences

### Positive ✅
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meets financial services security standards
- **Risk Mitigation**: Multi-layered defense against key compromise
- **Enterprise Ready**: Suitable for institutional trading operations
- **User Trust**: Hardware wallet support for user-controlled keys
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging for compliance and debugging

### Negative ⚠️
- **Complexity**: Significantly increases system complexity
- **Performance**: Security operations may introduce latency
- **Dependencies**: Requires integration with external security providers
- **Cost**: HSM and MPC services have operational costs
- **Testing**: Complex security scenarios are difficult to test

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Software-Only Security**
   - ✅ Simpler implementation  
   - ✅ Lower operational costs
   - ❌ Vulnerable to server compromise
   - ❌ Not suitable for enterprise use

2. **Single Security Method (HSM-only)**
   - ✅ Simplified architecture
   - ❌ Single point of failure
   - ❌ Limited user control options

3. **Third-Party Security Service**
   - ✅ Reduced implementation effort
   - ❌ Vendor lock-in
   - ❌ Less control over security policies

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Security Infrastructure
- Implement security manager with pluggable providers
- Add comprehensive audit logging
- Establish secure key derivation patterns

### Phase 2: HSM Integration
- Integrate with enterprise HSM providers (AWS CloudHSM, Azure Key Vault)
- Implement production-grade key operations
- Add performance optimization for signing operations

### Phase 3: Advanced Features  
- MPC protocol implementation for distributed signing
- Hardware wallet integration (Ledger, Trezor)
- Advanced threat detection and response

### Security Controls
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions with principle of least privilege
- **Data Protection**: End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- **Monitoring**: Real-time security event monitoring and alerting
- **Incident Response**: Automated threat detection and mitigation
