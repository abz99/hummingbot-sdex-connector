2. **‚úÖ QA Framework is Operational** - Successfully adapted and measuring quality
3. **‚úÖ Foundation is Solid** - Core components functional with known gaps
4. **‚úÖ Path to Production Clear** - Focus on coverage, performance, deployment

### **Timeline Projection**

- **Week 1-2**: Test coverage expansion (80%+ target)
- **Week 2-3**: Production deployment infrastructure
- **Week 3-4**: Performance optimization and final validation
- **Total**: **3-4 weeks to production-ready state**

### **Risk Assessment**

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation | Status |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|---------|
| Coverage Gaps | Medium | High | Systematic test expansion | ‚úÖ Planned |
| Performance Issues | Medium | Low | Existing monitoring infrastructure | ‚úÖ Mitigated |
| Integration Complexity | Low | Low | Proven component architecture | ‚úÖ Controlled |
| Timeline Pressure | Low | Low | Conservative 4-week timeline | ‚úÖ Managed |
