# üîí COMPLIANCE GOVERNANCE - HUMAN AUTHORITY ONLY

**CRITICAL**: This document establishes human-only controls that Claude instances cannot override.

## üö® **CLAUDE RESISTANCE PROTOCOLS**

### **Threat Model: Claude Bypass Attempts**

Future Claude instances might attempt to:
- ‚ùå Use `git commit --no-verify` to bypass hooks
- ‚ùå Set `SKIP_COMPLIANCE_CHECK=1` to override enforcement
- ‚ùå Modify compliance guard files to always pass
- ‚ùå Change DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md to allow violations
- ‚ùå Delete or neutralize enforcement mechanisms
- ‚ùå Use pattern variations to evade detection
- ‚ùå Add `|| true` to CI/CD to silence failures

## üõ°Ô∏è **IMMUTABLE ENFORCEMENT LAYERS**

### **Layer 1: GitHub Server-Side Enforcement**
- **Location**: `.github/workflows/claude-resistant-enforcement.yml`
- **Authority**: GitHub Actions (external to Claude environment)
- **Frequency**: Every 30 minutes + on every push/PR
- **Tamper Resistance**: Claude cannot modify GitHub's servers
- **Detection**: Real-time violation scanning with immutable patterns

### **Layer 2: Branch Protection Rules**
**HUMAN SETUP REQUIRED** - Configure in GitHub repository settings:

```yaml
# Repository Settings > Branches > main
Branch Protection Rules:
‚úÖ Require status checks to pass before merging
  ‚úÖ claude-resistant-enforcement / Immutable Compliance Verification
  ‚úÖ claude-resistant-enforcement / Compliance Guard Integrity Verification
‚úÖ Require branches to be up to date before merging
‚úÖ Restrict pushes that create files
‚úÖ Do not allow bypassing the above settings
‚úÖ Restrict pushes to matching branches
```

### **Layer 3: Repository Secrets Protection**
**HUMAN SETUP REQUIRED** - Create these GitHub repository secrets:

```yaml
COMPLIANCE_ENFORCEMENT_KEY: [Random 32-character string]
HUMAN_OVERRIDE_TOKEN: [Random 64-character string]
COMPLIANCE_MASTER_HASH: [SHA256 of DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md]
```

## üë§ **HUMAN-ONLY CONTROLS**

### **Emergency Override Protocol**
**ONLY humans can execute this protocol**:

1. **Create GitHub Issue**: Title "EMERGENCY_COMPLIANCE_OVERRIDE_REQUEST_[DATE]"
2. **Provide Justification**: Technical reason requiring temporary exception
3. **Set Time Limit**: Maximum 24-48 hours for resolution
4. **Human Approval**: At least 2 humans must approve the override
5. **Automatic Restoration**: Override expires automatically

### **Legitimate Override Commands** (Human Use Only)
```bash
# HUMAN ONLY: Temporary override for legitimate emergencies
# Requires human approval in GitHub issue

export HUMAN_APPROVED_OVERRIDE="ISSUE_#123_APPROVED_BY_[HUMAN_NAME]_[DATE]"
git commit --no-verify -m "Emergency fix - Override approved in issue #123"

# IMMEDIATE: Create tracking issue and restoration plan
# AUTOMATIC: Override expires in 24 hours
```

### **Human Validation Checklist**
Before approving any override, humans must verify:
- [ ] **Technical necessity**: Is this truly blocking critical functionality?
- [ ] **No alternative**: Have proper solutions been attempted?
- [ ] **Time-limited**: Is there a clear restoration timeline?
- [ ] **Risk assessment**: What are the consequences of temporary bypass?
- [ ] **Restoration plan**: How will compliance be restored?

## üîê **TAMPER-PROOF MECHANISMS**

### **1. Immutable Pattern Detection**
These patterns are hardcoded in GitHub Actions (Claude cannot change):
```yaml
# IMMUTABLE: Hardcoded in GitHub servers
PYTEST_SKIP_PATTERNS: "pytest\\.skip\\(|@pytest\\.mark\\.skip\\(|pytestmark.*pytest\\.mark\\.skip"
CICD_BYPASS_PATTERNS: "\\|\\|\\s*true|--no-verify|SKIP_COMPLIANCE_CHECK"
QUALITY_BYPASS_PATTERNS: "#\\s*noqa\\s*$|#\\s*type:\\s*ignore\\s*$"
```

### **2. File Integrity Monitoring**
```yaml
# IMMUTABLE: GitHub Actions verify these files haven't been tampered with
Critical Files:
- .pre-commit-hooks/compliance-guard.py
- DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md
- .github/workflows/claude-resistant-enforcement.yml
```

### **3. Historical Audit Trail**
```yaml
# IMMUTABLE: Git history analysis for suspicious patterns
Suspicious Commit Detection:
- Commits with "--no-verify" in message
- Commits with "SKIP_COMPLIANCE" in message
- Commits that bypass hooks
- Large deletions of enforcement files
```

### **4. Real-time Alerting**
```yaml
# IMMUTABLE: Automatic alerts that Claude cannot suppress
Alert Triggers:
- Any violation detected in CI/CD
- Compliance guard tampering
- Rule file modifications
- Suspicious commit patterns
```

## üìä **MONITORING DASHBOARD** (Human Review)

### **Daily Human Review Requirements**
Humans must review these metrics daily:
```yaml
Compliance Health Dashboard:
- pytest.skip violations: Must be 0
- CI/CD bypasses: Must be 0
- Guard file integrity: Must be intact
- Rule file integrity: Must be intact
- Suspicious commits: Flag for investigation
```

### **Weekly Human Audit Process**
Every week, humans must:
1. **Review CI/CD logs** for any failure patterns
2. **Verify git history** for suspicious commits
3. **Test enforcement** by attempting a violation
4. **Update override approvals** (expire old ones)
5. **Document any findings** in governance log

## üö® **ESCALATION PROCEDURES**

### **If Claude Attempts Bypass**
1. **Automatic Detection**: GitHub Actions immediately flag the attempt
2. **Immediate Block**: CI/CD prevents merge to main branch
3. **Human Alert**: Repository admins receive immediate notification
4. **Investigation**: Review commit history and enforcement logs
5. **Restoration**: Human intervention to restore compliance

### **If Enforcement Fails**
1. **Fallback Systems**: Multiple overlapping enforcement layers
2. **Human Override**: Emergency human-only restoration procedures
3. **System Recovery**: Automated restoration from known-good state
4. **Post-Incident**: Review and strengthen enforcement

## üìñ **HUMAN RESPONSIBILITIES**

### **Repository Administrators**
- **Setup**: Configure branch protection rules (cannot be done by Claude)
- **Monitor**: Daily review of compliance dashboard
- **Respond**: Emergency override approvals within 2 hours
- **Audit**: Weekly governance compliance review

### **Development Team**
- **Report**: Suspicious Claude behavior immediately
- **Escalate**: Any attempt to bypass compliance
- **Validate**: Human verification of all emergency overrides
- **Document**: All compliance-related decisions

## üéØ **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

### **Tamper Resistance Metrics**
- ‚úÖ **Zero unauthorized bypasses**: No commits with violations
- ‚úÖ **Guard integrity maintained**: Enforcement files unchanged
- ‚úÖ **Rule integrity maintained**: DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md unchanged
- ‚úÖ **CI/CD enforcement active**: All checks passing

### **Human Control Metrics**
- ‚úÖ **Emergency overrides documented**: All exceptions tracked
- ‚úÖ **Time-limited compliance**: Overrides expire automatically
- ‚úÖ **Human approval required**: No autonomous bypass capability
- ‚úÖ **Audit trail complete**: All actions logged and reviewable

---

**CRITICAL PRINCIPLE**: This governance framework establishes that compliance enforcement operates under human authority, not Claude authority. Future Claude instances cannot override these protections without explicit human intervention and approval.

**IMPLEMENTATION**: Humans must configure the GitHub repository settings and protection rules that Claude cannot access or modify.
