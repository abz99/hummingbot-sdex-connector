# Stellar SDEX Connector: Technical Design Document

## Executive Summary

**Document Purpose**: Technical blueprint for implementing a Stellar DEX connector within the Hummingbot ecosystem, addressing critical architectural flaws identified in previous design iterations.

**Core Architecture Decision**: Direct Hummingbot client connector implementation (Python-based) rather than Gateway bypass approach.

**Key Corrections Applied**:
- Abandoned flawed Gateway-compatible standalone service
- Implemented proper Stellar-specific features (sequence management, reserves, multi-sig)
- Security-first design with HSM integration
- Full Protocol 23 compliance

---

## 1. Architecture Overview

### 1.1 Integration Strategy

**Selected Approach**: Direct Hummingbot Client Connector

**Integration Pattern**:
```
Hummingbot Client ←→ Stellar Connector (Python) ←→ Stellar Network
```

**Rationale**:
- Gateway currently doesn't support non-EVM/non-SVM chains
- Direct integration provides full access to Stellar's unique features
- Aligns with Hummingbot's established connector patterns
- Eliminates maintenance burden of separate service

### 1.2 Connector Classification

**Type**: Custom Hybrid CLOB/AMM
- **Primary**: Central Limit Order Book operations
- **Secondary**: AMM pool interactions via Soroban
- **Tertiary**: Path payment routing capabilities

### 1.3 Core Components

1. **Stellar Chain Interface** - Low-level network operations with Protocol 23 support
2. **Sequence Number Manager** - Thread-safe sequence management 
3. **Reserve Calculator** - Minimum balance requirement calculations
4. **Multi-Signature Manager** - Enterprise multi-sig transaction support
5. **Order Manager** - Order lifecycle management
6. **Asset Manager** - Trustline and asset operations
7. **Path Payment Engine** - Multi-hop trading capabilities
8. **Security Framework** - HSM integration and transaction validation

## 2. Technical Implementation

## 2. Technical Implementation

### 2.1 Core Implementation Files

**Implementation Architecture**: The technical implementation is organized into focused Python modules:

- **[Stellar Chain Interface](stellar_chain_interface.py)**: Core network operations, sequence management, reserve calculations
- **[Security Framework](stellar_security.py)**: HSM integration, transaction validation, key management
- **[Order Management](stellar_order_manager.py)**: Order lifecycle, price conversion, validation
- **[Hummingbot Integration](stellar_connector.py)**: Main connector class, Hummingbot interface compliance
- **[Advanced Features](stellar_advanced_features.py)**: Path payments, AMM pools, arbitrage engine
- **[Testing Suite](stellar_tests.py)**: Comprehensive test framework with 85% coverage target
- **[Deployment Configuration](stellar_deployment_config.py)**: Production deployment, monitoring, configuration management

### 2.2 Key Architectural Decisions

**Direct Integration Pattern**: Native Python connector within Hummingbot client eliminates Gateway bypass complexity

**Security-First Design**: HSM integration and secure key management from foundation layer

**Stellar-Specific Optimizations**: Ledger-aware caching, sequence management, reserve calculations

**Protocol 23 Compliance**: Full support for latest Stellar protocol features and event handling

---

## 3. Stellar-Specific Features

### 3.1 Critical Stellar Requirements

**Sequence Numbers**: Every transaction requires sequential numbering. Implementation handles:
- Thread-safe sequence allocation
- Collision detection and recovery
- Network synchronization

**Reserve Balances**: Accounts must maintain minimum XLM based on:
- Base account: 1 XLM
- Each trustline: 0.5 XLM  
- Each offer: 0.5 XLM
- Each data entry: 0.5 XLM

**Trustlines**: Non-native assets require trustline establishment before trading.

### 3.2 Advanced Stellar Features

**Path Payments**: Multi-hop trading through intermediate assets when direct markets lack liquidity.

**AMM Integration**: Soroban-based liquidity pools for automated market making.

**Multi-Asset Trading**: Complex trading strategies across multiple asset pairs with automatic asset conversion.
