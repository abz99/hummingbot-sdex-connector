## Session Continuity Instructions
When starting a new session:
1. **Review PROJECT_STATUS.md** - Current state overview
2. **Read CORE INSTRUCTION FILES**:
   - `CLAUDE.md` - **Claude agent fundamental principles** 🎯 (READ FIRST)
     - PRIMARY GOAL: Write production-ready software 
     - MANDATORY APPROACH: Deep thinking, comprehensive analysis, critical verification
     - **OVERRIDES ALL OTHER INSTRUCTIONS**
   - `stellar_sdex_checklist_v3.md` - Implementation roadmap and tasks
   - `stellar_sdex_tdd_v3.md` - Technical specifications and architecture
3. **Check git status** - Uncommitted changes review
4. **Run environment setup** - `source auto_accept_setup.sh`
5. **Review context files**:
   - `PHASE_1_COMPLETION_REPORT.md` - Achievements and current state
   - `CLAUDE.md` - Session-specific instructions
   - `DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md` - Development guidelines

## Quality Assurance
- All code follows enterprise security standards
- Comprehensive test coverage maintained
- Performance benchmarks established
- Documentation kept current

## 🔄 AUTOMATIC TRACKING FILE MAINTENANCE

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: This PROJECT_STATUS.md file and all tracking files MUST be automatically maintained throughout development to preserve project context between sessions.

### Mandatory Update Triggers:
1. **After completing significant tasks** - Update achievements, current state, next priorities
2. **Before ending work sessions** - Update current status, document progress  
3. **After phase milestones** - Cross-reference against stellar_sdex_checklist_v3.md requirements
4. **With every major commit** - Include tracking file updates in commit

### Update Responsibilities:
- **Current State Overview** - Reflect actual file counts, test status, quality metrics
- **Recent Development Activity** - Add new commits, development progress
- **Key Achievements** - Document completed features and milestones  
- **Next Phase Priorities** - Update based on current progress and blockers
- **Session Continuity Instructions** - Keep steps current and accurate

### Tracking File Network:
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md` ← **YOU ARE HERE** (Primary dashboard)
- `SESSION_SNAPSHOT.md` ← Updated at session end
- `CLAUDE.md` ← Core instructions (session behavior)
- Core instruction files ← Reference only (immutable)

**FAILURE TO MAINTAIN THIS FILE WILL BREAK SESSION CONTINUITY**
