- **Documentation**: Update PROJECT_STATUS.md with scope change impact
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Clear communication of timeline/resource implications

### Quality Issues
- **Detection**: qa_id failures or reviewer rejection
- **Action**: Loop back to appropriate phase with specific feedback
- **Tracking**: Document quality debt and remediation plan
- **Prevention**: Enhanced quality gate enforcement

### Timeline Concerns
- **Assessment**: Velocity tracking and milestone risk analysis
- **Action**: Re-prioritize backlog and communicate to stakeholders
- **Documentation**: Update PROJECT_STATUS.md with revised estimates
- **Mitigation**: Resource reallocation or scope adjustment

## OPERATIONAL PROTOCOLS
