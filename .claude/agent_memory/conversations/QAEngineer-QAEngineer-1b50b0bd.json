        "task": "Phase 2 QA Strategy - Trading Tier Testing Framework. Design comprehensive testing strategy for stellar_liquidity_management.py and stellar_yield_farming.py integration. Testing must cover: complex trading algorithms with 11 strategies total (5 liquidity + 6 yield), financial calculations (PnL, APY, volatility, risk scores), inventory management edge cases, cross-market arbitrage logic, automated compound farming. Ensure 100% test coverage following DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md: NEVER SKIP FAILING TESTS. Create test framework that validates both unit functionality and integration with enterprise/trading/ tier architecture.",
        "context": "Phase 2 integrates 2,263 lines of complex financial code requiring rigorous testing: AssetInventory with rebalancing logic, LiquidityProvision with strategy execution, YieldPosition with compound calculations. Test categories: unit tests for individual strategies, integration tests with enterprise framework, financial accuracy tests, risk management validation, error handling scenarios. Must achieve 100% success rate like Phase 1 (8/8 tests passing). Testing infrastructure must support async operations, mock external services, validate security controls."
