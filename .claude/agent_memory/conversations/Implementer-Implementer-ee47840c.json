Execute the approved implementation plan: create enterprise/trading/ module structure, move and refactor stellar_liquidity_management.py (1,147 lines) and stellar_yield_farming.py (1,116 lines) into enterprise tier following Phase 1 patterns. Implement TradingFeatureRegistry, update EnterpriseFeatureConfig for trading features (liquidity_management_enabled, yield_farming_enabled), create __init__.py with proper exports, ensure backward compatibility and relative imports. All work must pass comprehensive testing - NEVER SKIP FAILING TESTS.",
