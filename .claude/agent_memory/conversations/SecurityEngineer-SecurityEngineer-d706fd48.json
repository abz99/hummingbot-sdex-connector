Need complete redesign of security scanning approach: 1) Fix artifact upload expecting missing files, 2) Redesign security test workflow to generate reports correctly, 3) Ensure comprehensive security validation without false positives, 4) Maintain enterprise-grade security standards. This is blocking final CI pipeline success.",
