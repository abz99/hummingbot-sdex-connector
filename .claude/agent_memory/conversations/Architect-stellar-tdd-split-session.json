Split into focused, manageable documents (architecture, implementation, security, etc.)\n3. Cross-referenced with existing project documentation\n4. Updated to reflect current project status and implementation progress\n\nPlease coordinate with appropriate agents to handle this document restructuring while maintaining technical accuracy and project continuity.",
