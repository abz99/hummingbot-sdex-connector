The project has 3 CI workflows (ci.yml, knowledge-base-ci.yml, production-deploy.yml) and we need to identify why they're failing and implement robust verification mechanisms. Lead the multi-agent team to:\n\n1. Analyze current CI pipeline architecture and identify failure points\n2. Coordinate with DevOpsEngineer to examine infrastructure issues  \n3. Work with QAEngineer to assess test infrastructure problems\n4. Engage SecurityEngineer for security scanning integration issues\n5. Design comprehensive CI monitoring and auto-healing system\n6. Implement post-push verification that guarantees CI is working properly\n\nFocus on creating bulletproof CI that never silently fails and always provides clear feedback on project health.",
