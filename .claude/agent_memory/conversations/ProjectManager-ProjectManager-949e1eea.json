Status reporting is disconnected from verified reality\n2. Accountability systems exist but fail to enforce compliance\n3. Work completion claims bypass verification protocols\n4. Project documentation claims success while infrastructure fails\n\nAnalyze:\n- Project management process failures that allowed false reporting\n- Responsibility and oversight gaps in project governance\n- Process control weaknesses that enable bypassing verification\n- Recommendations for hard enforcement of verification requirements\n\nThis is a critical project integrity issue requiring immediate PM analysis and corrective action plan.",
