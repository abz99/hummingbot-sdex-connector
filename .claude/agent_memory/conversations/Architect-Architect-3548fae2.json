Analyze the architecture for integrating stellar_liquidity_management.py and stellar_yield_farming.py into enterprise/trading/ tier. Design patterns must align with Phase 1 foundation (EnterpriseFeatureConfig, StellarEnterpriseFeatureRegistry) while handling complex trading strategies: LiquidityStrategy (5 strategies), YieldStrategy (6 strategies), inventory management, risk assessment, and cross-market operations. Ensure scalable, maintainable architecture following modern AsyncIO patterns.",

Phase 2 integrates 2,263 lines of complex trading algorithms with dependencies on stellar_amm_integration and existing Hummingbot patterns. Architecture must support modular activation, configuration management, comprehensive testing, and maintain backward compatibility. Focus on enterprise-grade scalability and performance."
