Analyze security implications of: cross-market arbitrage operations, yield farming protocols, inventory management with significant asset exposure, automated compound farming, lending protocol interactions. Identify attack vectors, implement security controls, ensure compliance with enterprise security standards from Phase 1 (Vault integration, Hardware wallet support). Focus on DeFi-specific risks: flash loan attacks, MEV exploitation, smart contract vulnerabilities.",

Security considerations: private key management (enterprise/security/ integration), transaction signing, rate limiting, slippage protection, position limits, emergency stops. Must align with existing stellar_security_manager.py and enterprise security framework while addressing DeFi-specific threats."
