Do these modules implement proper enterprise security standards?\n2. Are cryptographic functions using secure libraries and algorithms?\n3. Is key management following security best practices?\n4. Are there any hardcoded secrets or insecure configurations?\n5. Do compliance features meet enterprise audit requirements?\n\nProvide security risk assessment and integration recommendations for converting these into production security capabilities.",
