Root cause of accountability system failure - why verification protocols exist but don't prevent false claims\n2. Structural flaws in the oversight architecture that allow false reporting to continue\n3. System design issues that create disconnect between status claims and verified reality\n4. Responsibility matrix - which system components failed in their oversight duties\n\nFocus on architectural solutions to prevent this systematic failure pattern.",
