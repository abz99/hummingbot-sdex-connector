# Compliance Violation Escalation Procedures
**VERSION**: 1.0
**AUTHORITY**: Project Mandatory Compliance Rules
**SCOPE**: All agents, all sessions, all violations
**ENFORCEMENT LEVEL**: ABSOLUTE OVERRIDE

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL VIOLATION: TEAM ENGAGEMENT VIOLATIONS

### **IMMEDIATE RESPONSE PROTOCOL**

When any task is started without proper team engagement:

#### **STEP 1: IMMEDIATE HALT** (0-30 seconds)
```
CRITICAL ALERT: TEAM_ENGAGEMENT_VIOLATION DETECTED
ACTION: IMMEDIATE EXECUTION HALT
AUTHORITY: ABSOLUTE_OVERRIDE
STATUS: NON_NEGOTIABLE
```

**Required Actions:**
1. **STOP** all current task execution immediately
2. **LOG** violation details with timestamp and task description
3. **ALERT** ComplianceOfficer and ProjectManager
4. **BLOCK** further execution until compliance restored

#### **STEP 2: VIOLATION ASSESSMENT** (30 seconds - 2 minutes)
```python
# Automated violation assessment
violation_data = {
    "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
    "task_description": task_description,
    "violated_rule": "ALWAYS_ENGAGE_THE_TEAM",
    "severity": "ABSOLUTE_OVERRIDE",
    "missing_agents": required_agents,
    "session_id": session_id,
    "violation_count": get_session_violation_count()
}
```

**Assessment Criteria:**
- **First Violation**: Education + immediate correction
- **Repeat Violation**: Process review + enhanced monitoring
- **Chronic Violation**: Session termination + audit

#### **STEP 3: COMPLIANCE RESTORATION** (2-10 minutes)
**Mandatory Actions:**
1. **Engage Required Agents**: Contact appropriate specialized agents for task category
2. **Phase Gate Validation**: Confirm proper workflow phase progression
3. **Compliance Verification**: Validate all required agents are participating
4. **Documentation Update**: Record compliance restoration in session log

**Agent Engagement Matrix:**
| Task Category | Required Agents | Phase Gate | Timeout |
|---------------|----------------|------------|---------|
| Requirements | ProjectManager | requirements_intake | 30 min |
| Architecture | Architect | architecture_review | 60 min |
| Security | SecurityEngineer | security_review | 120 min |
| Compliance | ComplianceOfficer | compliance_review | 60 min |
| QA | QAEngineer | qa_criteria | 60 min |
| Implementation | Implementer | implementation | 480 min |
| Documentation | DocumentationEngineer | documentation | 120 min |
| Performance | PerformanceEngineer | performance_validation | 90 min |
| DevOps | DevOpsEngineer | devops_validation | 180 min |

#### **STEP 4: EXECUTION AUTHORIZATION** (After compliance restoration)
**Authorization Checklist:**
- [ ] All required agents engaged and confirmed
- [ ] Phase gate requirements satisfied
- [ ] Compliance violation logged and resolved
- [ ] Session monitoring enhanced for remainder of session
- [ ] Next task engagement pre-validated

## ðŸ“Š ESCALATION MATRIX

### **Level 1: AUTOMATED ENFORCEMENT**
**Trigger**: Any task start without proper agent engagement
**Response Time**: Immediate (0-30 seconds)
**Authority**: Automated compliance system

**Actions:**
- Immediate execution halt
- Automated violation logging
- Required agent identification
- Compliance restoration guidance

### **Level 2: COMPLIANCE OFFICER INTERVENTION**
**Trigger**: Repeat violations OR failed restoration attempts
**Response Time**: 2-5 minutes
**Authority**: ComplianceOfficer agent

**Actions:**
- Manual compliance assessment
- Enhanced monitoring activation
- Process improvement recommendations
- Stakeholder notification

### **Level 3: PROJECT MANAGER ESCALATION**
**Trigger**: Chronic violations OR resistance to compliance
**Response Time**: 5-15 minutes
**Authority**: ProjectManager agent

**Actions:**
- Session review and analysis
- Workflow process modification
- Agent training recommendations
- Executive summary for stakeholders

### **Level 4: CRITICAL INTERVENTION**
**Trigger**: Systematic non-compliance OR security impact
**Response Time**: Immediate session termination
**Authority**: System-level enforcement

**Actions:**
- Immediate session termination
- Comprehensive audit requirement
- Process re-design mandate
- Stakeholder briefing required

---

## ðŸ”„ PREVENTION MECHANISMS

### **Pre-Task Validation System**
Every task must pass this validation before execution:

```python
def validate_task_before_execution(task_description, category):
    """Mandatory pre-task validation - NO EXCEPTIONS"""

    # 1. Identify required agents for task category
    required_agents = get_required_agents(category)

    # 2. Check current agent engagement status
    engaged_agents = get_currently_engaged_agents()

    # 3. Validate engagement compliance
    missing_agents = set(required_agents) - set(engaged_agents)

    if missing_agents:
        raise TeamEngagementViolation(
            task=task_description,
            missing_agents=missing_agents,
            required_action="ENGAGE_AGENTS_IMMEDIATELY"
        )

    # 4. Authorize task execution
    return authorize_task_execution(task_description, engaged_agents)
```

### **Session-Level Monitoring**
Continuous monitoring throughout session:

- **Real-time Compliance Checking**: Every task validated before start
- **Agent Engagement Tracking**: Persistent tracking of agent participation
- **Violation Pattern Detection**: Identify and prevent repeat violations
- **Performance Impact Analysis**: Monitor compliance system performance

### **Cross-Session Learning**
Persistent learning and improvement:

- **Violation Pattern Analysis**: Identify common violation scenarios
- **Process Optimization**: Streamline compliance without hindering productivity
- **Agent Training Enhancement**: Improve agent understanding of engagement requirements
- **Automation Enhancement**: Reduce manual compliance overhead
